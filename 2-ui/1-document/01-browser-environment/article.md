# Browser environment, specs

The JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. But as of now, it evolved and became a language with many uses and platforms.

A platform may be either a browser or a web-server or a washing machine or another *host*. Each of them provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript standard called that a *host environment*.

That host environment provides additional objects and functions to the language core. Web browsers provide means to control web pages. Node.JS provides server-side features. There are other host environments too.

Here's a bird-eye view of what we have when JavaScript runs in a web-browser:

![](windowObjects.png)

The "root object" called `window` has two roles:

1. First, it is a [global object](info:global-object) for JavaScript code.
2. Second, it represents the "browser window" object, provides methods to control it.

For instance, here we use it as a global object:

```js run
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hello");
}

alert(window.sayHi); // global function is a property of window
```

And here we use it as a browser window, to see the window height:

```js run
alert(window.innerHeight); // some number
```

## Document Object Model (DOM)

The `document` object gives access to a page's content. We can change or create literally anything.

For instance:
```js run
// change the background color to red
document.body.style.background = 'red';

// change it back after 1 second
setTimeout(() => document.body.style.background = '', 1000);
```

Here we used `document.body.style`, but there's much, much more. Properties and methods are described in the specification.

There are two working groups who develop it:

1. [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) -- the documentation is at <https://www.w3.org/TR/dom>.
2. [WhatWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG), publishing at <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org>.

As it happens, the two groups don't always agree, so we have like 2 sets of standards. But they are in tight contact and eventually things merge. So the documentation that you can find on the given resources is very similar, like 99%. There are very minor differences, but you probably won't notice them.

I find <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org> more pleasant to use, and so recommend it.

In the ancient past, once there was no standard at all -- each browser did whatever it wanted. So different browsers had different sets methods and properties for the same thing, and developers had to write different code for each of them. Dark times indeed.

Even now we can sometimes meet old code that uses browser-specific properties and works around incompatibilities. But in this tutorial we'll use modern stuff: there's no need to learn old things until you really need those (chances are high you won't).

Then the DOM standard appeared, in an attempt to bring everyone to an agreement. The first version was DOM Level 1, then it was extended by DOM Level 2, then DOM Level 3, and now it's DOM Level 4.

People from WhatWG group got tired of version and are calling that just "DOM", without a number. So will do we.

```smart header="DOM is not only for browsers"
The DOM specification explains the structure of a document and provides objects to manipulate it. There are non-browser instruments that use it too.

For instance, server-side tools that download HTML pages and process them. They may support only a part of the DOM specification though.
```

```smart header="CSSOM for styling"
CSS styles and stylesheets are structured not like HTML. So there's a separate specification [CSSOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/) that explains how CSS styles and rules can be represented as objects, how to read and write them.

Usually we take a style somewhere from the document and apply it to the document, so CSSOM is used together with DOM. But CSSOM is applied not often, because we rarely need to modify CSS rules from JavaScript, so we won't cover it right now.
```

## BOM (part of HTML spec)

Browser Object Model (BOM) are additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) to work with everything except the document.

For instance:

- [navigator](mdn:api/Window/navigator) object provides background information about the browser and the operation system. There are many properties, but two most widely known are: `navigator.userAgent` -- about the current browser, and `navigator.platform` -- about the platform (can help to differ between Windows/Linux/Mac etc).
- [location](mdn:api/Window/location) object allows to read the current URL and redirect the browser to a new one.

Here's how we can use the `location` object:

```js run
alert(location.href); // shows current URL
if (confirm("Go to wikipedia?")) {
  location.href = 'https://wikipedia.org'; // redirect the browser to another URL
}
```

Functions `alert/confirm/prompt` -- are also a part of BOM: they are directly not related to the document, but represent pure browser methods of communicating with the user.


```smart header="HTML specification"
BOM is the part of the general [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org).

Yes, you heard that right. The HTML spec at <https://html.spec.whatwg.org> is not only about the "HTML language" (tags, attributes), but also covers a bunch of objects, methods and browser-specific DOM extensions. That's "HTML in broad terms".
```

## Summary

Talking about standards, we have:

DOM specification
: Describes the document structure, manipulations and events, see <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org>.

CSSOM specification
: Describes styles, manipulations with them and their binding to documents, see <https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/>.

HTML specification
: Describes HTML language (tags etc) and also BOM (browser object model) -- various browser functions: `setTimeout`, `alert`, `location` and so on, see <https://html.spec.whatwg.org>. It takes DOM specification and extends it with many additional properties and methods.

Now we'll get down to learning DOM, because the document plays the central role in the UI, and working with it is the most complex part.

Please note the links above, because there's so many stuff to learn, it's impossible to cover and remember everything. When you'd like to read about a property or a method -- the Mozilla manual at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search> is a nice one, but reading the corresponding spec may be better. More complex and longer to read, but will make your fundamental knowledge sound and complete.
